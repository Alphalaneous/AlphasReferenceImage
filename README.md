# Alpha's Reference Image

Adds the ability to add references images within the editor.
These images will persist between sessions, no need to reimport every time you open the editor.

Press the <cg>Ref</c> button in the edit tab to add one, you can always change the image later by editing that object and pressing Image on the top right.

<cr>These images use text objects with the image path, be sure to remove them before uploading the level if you do not wish for the path to be seen.</c>

This is not an image importer mod, it will not be visible when playing the level!
